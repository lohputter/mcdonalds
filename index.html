            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>This was founded by a perfectly legal age Lyndon (16) where we serve you good food for good prices. No price. Lyndon is a boy who came straight to Breakfast City after he casually burnt down a culinary school when he tried to cook an omlette. Anyways..he decided to open up his own McDonalds at Breakfast City. You can find it by looking for the giant yellow <span>M</span>. If you want to apply for a job here, check the Staff page. Check the Menu page to see the menu.</p>

            <h1>Why Us?</h1>
            <p>Why us indeed? Frankly, not very sure. However, I can tell you one thing for certain.</p>
            <blockquote>
                We will give you what you deserve, not what you want. We shall never give you what you want, but what you deserve.
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is one of the most important mottos in our business.</p>
            <p>Ask yourself..</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you going to ruin your life by choosing Filet o' Fish?</li>
                <li>Are one of your friends being extra annoying?</li>
                <li>Are you being considerably annoying and I want to make you less annoying?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Well, guess what? Our motto solves ALL of that.</p>

            <h1>Details</h1>
            <h2>Opening Hours</h2>
            <p>Whenever Lyndon or an employee is in McDonalds, it's open. No fixed timings.</p>
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>Like I said before, go to Breakfast City, then look for a village house with a big yellow <span>M</span> on it.</p>
            <h2>Contact Info</h2>
            <p>Do not give information to strangers. Trust, trust.</p>

            <h1>How To Order</h1>
            <h2>To-Go</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to McDonalds and tell an employee your order.</li>
                <li>Wait at McDonalds and watch the people around you acting like NPCs.</li>
                <li>Using our sophiscated packing method, you will get your food fresh and warm.</li>
                <li>The employee will just throw the food towards you. Catch it. And leave.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's how you order food to go.</p>
            <h2>Dine In</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to McDonalds and order.</li>
                <li>Look for a staircase to sit at and wait patiently..</li>
                <li>The employee will throw the food towards you with IMMENSE SKILL.</li>
                <li>Eat your food, then leave.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's how you dine in.</p>
            <h2>Drive Thru</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Head towards the window at the right and scream for my attention because I likely need motivation to actually listen to your order.</li>
                <li>Say order, then turn left and go to the window behind.</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>If there is someone behind you, please move forward to the window in front. There are 2 windows.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>An employee will arrive, throw you your food with IMMENSE SKILL.</li>
                <li>Leave.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And that's how the drive thru works!</p>
